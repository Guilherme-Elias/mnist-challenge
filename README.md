# The MNIST Challenge

## About

This repo constains my solution to the MNIST problem. 

- The challenge is to train a neural network able to automatically recognise handwritten digits with more than 90% accuracy

- The MNIST dataset was used for training - it is available <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>

## Disclaimer

- This project was a self-elaborated learning journey starter on deep learning. Consider that when evaluating or using it

- In the sense of a more complete learning experience - but less realistic, this project contains no dependencies except for Python v3.10.0
